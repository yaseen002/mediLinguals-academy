# MediLinguals Academy

## Project Overview
MediLinguals Academy is an ERP-like e-learning platform designed to integrate the management of learning, user activities, and administrative workflows.  
The system was developed using **Python**, **Flask**, and **PostgreSQL**, and deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for scalability and secure real-time data handling.

## How the Application Works
1. **User Access**  
   - Users access the platform via a web browser.  
   - The system authenticates the user with secure login credentials.  

2. **Role-Based Dashboard**  
   - After login, the system redirects users to their respective dashboards.  
   - Each dashboard provides customized tools and data visualization relevant to the user’s role.  

3. **Content & Data Management**  
   - Teachers upload course materials, assignments, and quizzes.  
   - Students interact with the materials and submit assignments.  
   - PostgreSQL ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.  

4. **ERP-Style Administration**  
   - Administrators manage users, monitor academic performance, and configure system modules.  
   - Built-in reporting tools provide insights into learning activities and organizational metrics.  

5. **Scalability & Security**  
   - The application leverages GCP services for load balancing, real-time data updates, and continuous availability.  
   - Data is securely transmitted and stored with encryption mechanisms.
